 * release-methodology.md) defines four short-tier workflow branch types
 * that fork from `staging`:
 *
 *   prod ── staging ── feature   (active feature dev)
 *                  ├── test      (integration testing)
 *                  ├── uat       (user acceptance)
 *                  └── perf      (performance / load)
 *
 * Each is finite-lifetime – tied to a specific dev cycle, not a permanent
 * tier. So unlike `createLongRunningBranch` (which sets `no_expiry: true`
 * for the prod/staging tiers), these helpers default to a Lakebase TTL.
 *
 * Per-tier TTL defaults (override via `args.ttl`):
 *   feature: 30 days (typical feature dev cycle)
 *   test:    14 days
 *   uat:     14 days
 *   perf:     7 days
 *
 * All four fork from `staging` by default. Callers in non-staging-rooted
 * projects can override via `parentBranch`.

 * workspaces enforce a tighter maximum-expiration policy. Workspaces

 * env var on KIT_TIMEOUTS (e.g.
 * `LAKEBASE_KIT_FEATURE_BRANCH_TTL_MS=604800000` for 7-day feature
